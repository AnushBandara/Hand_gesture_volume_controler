My first computer vision project – HandVolumeControler.py! 🎉

Libraries : cv2, mediapipe, osascript, numpy, time, math, 

Using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Osascript, I built a gesture-based system that lets you control your computer’s volume by moving your thumb and index finger closer or farther apart. Imagine changing your volume just like the gestures in Apple Vision Pro – no mouse, no keyboard, just your hands! 🖐️🔊

This project may look simple on the surface, but it really opened my eyes to the power of computer vision. I learned:
✅ How MediaPipe can track hand landmarks with high accuracy
✅ How to translate finger distances into real-time volume changes
✅ How small ideas can become the foundation for bigger systems, like gesture-based VR/AR controls

👉 While there’s no direct implementation out there for this exact use case, I see this as a starting point for more intuitive human-computer interaction systems.

This is just the beginning, and I’m excited to keep exploring how AI, CV, and gesture recognition can shape the future of immersive experiences.

💡 If anyone is working on VR/AR, gesture-based UI, or human-computer interaction, I’d love to connect and hear your thoughts!

Do you want me to also draft a shorter, more casual version (like a personal milestone update) that feels less technical and more celebratory for your network?
